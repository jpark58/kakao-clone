## Tips for styles

### Reset.css

This css file reset all the styles to zero. For example, zero paddings, zero margins, etc.  
It will save our time to modify the style of each element. Basically, I will customize it on my own.

### Import Google Font

Go to Google Font and pick 'Open Sans'. We will use regular and bold font.  
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans:wght@400;700&display=swap');
